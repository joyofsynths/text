            <h2>Does Voltage Make a Sound?</h2>
             <p>Let's start at zero volts with an Analog Modular Synthesizer Summary. </p>
             <p>An analog synthesizer is a physical instrument that converts voltage into a sound signal. That is the magic of audio synthesis. </p>
             <p>An analog synthesizer is a sum of parts. These parts are modules, hence the term "modular synthesizer."  </p><img class="img2" src="joy-of-synths-logo-01-2022-0407-400x400.gif" alt="heart shaped logo" title="joy of synths heart shaped logo"><p>Modular synthesizer modules are standalone units that are collected and provided power in a don't do anything until you connect them together and you provide power in a box/case/skiff/eurorack rack. "Patch Cables" are 3.5mm mono cables that serve as a bridge for signal to travel from one module to another module. In closing, if modules are not wired together with patch cables, nothing will happen. </p>
             <h3>Semi-Modular Synthesizers</h3>
             <p>An all-in-one powered synthesizer is called semi-modular. The advantage is that modules are pre-wired. This reduces the need for external wiring with patch cables. The synthesizer is semi-modular if it has open mini-jacks or a patchbay of mini-jacks that allow you to rewire the signal. </p>
            
             <p>Rewiring means you can send and receive signals from external devices. This can be a controller device like a keyboard controller or an analog step sequencer, which can repeat a number of notes, or steps. The keyboard and step sequencer transmit control voltage signals and gate/trigger signals. </p>
             <p>So, does voltage make a sound? Depends. Control voltage and gate/trigger signals are voltage generated by a controller. Hence, control voltage. This is silent.</p>
             <h4>Oscillators: VCO and LFO</h4>
             <p>Sound is generated by an oscillator. An oscillator generates waveshapes. Whether or not you can hear an oscillator depends on the voltage reaching the oscillator. </p>
             <h5>Frequency</h5>
             <p>The range of human hearing is 20Hz to 20,000 Hz. Below 20Hz and above 20,000 Hz is said to be inaudible. </p>
             <p>Oscillators can run the range of frequencies. A Low Frequency Oscillator, or LFO, is inaudible until you turn the dial full right. This low frequency takes advantage of waveshapes. </p>
             <p>For example, a square waveshape is high, low, or on/off/on/off. A square LFO can be used to modulate other modules. Basically, you wire the LFO to send signal to a control dial. The LFO rate is turning the dial high/low, high/low, so you don't have to. </p>
             <p>In review, a Modular Synthesizer is constructed of modules. A semi-modular synthesizer is pre-wired, with open jacks for you to connect external devices. A keyboard controller or step sequencer will send controlling voltage to a synthesizer. A controller's control voltage is silent. </p>
             <h4>Audio is Control Voltage</h4>
             <p>This is the fun stuff. An LFO signal is a low-frequency audio signal. Audio connected to a control voltage input will modulate that control dial. Low frequency means you can hear a sudden high/low change, or a rise between high and low signal. 
             </p>
             <h2>A Modular Synthesizer is best when its modules can be modulated. </h2>
             <p>I'm a semi-modular fan. I have an ice tray repurposed as a modular rack for six modules. This requires a lot of patch cables. Getting the two to play together depends on the semi-modular instrument. Some are a closed audio system that allow control voltage in. Others may be really open. But it's the pre-wiring that can get confusing when you get started with analog synthesizers.</p>
             <p>In closing, analog synthesizers are a great instrument for creating unique sounds. Just know that controller signals are also known as control voltage. And a keyboard or sequencer controller sends voltage signals that are labelled as control voltage or gate signals. Both are silent. Both are capable of changing sound in magical ways. </p>
             
             
                 
            
         <p> The oscillator frequency, or pitch, is voltage controlled. This kind of oscillator is a VCO, or voltage controlled oscillator. It can be changed with voltage, as well, </p>
             <p>
             can generate an audio signal and filter out frequencies and make the sound louder and quieter by using voltage. </p>
         <p>The signals traveling through a synthesizer are audio signals and control voltage, or CV. The key thing is that audio signal has energy. An audio signal's amplitude can serve as control voltage.</p>
     <p>    
You are working with audio signal and voltage signals. </p>
             <p>Voltage alone doesn't create sound. Signals travelling in a synthesizer are audio signals or voltage that can change, or modulate, dial controls. </p>
