            <h2>Playing Not Paying 10/14/22</h2>
             <p> It is October and the sales are kicking in for certain synths. The Model D clone is available for $265, the 2600 clone for $492, and the Grey Meanie 2600 for $566.</p>
             <p>I bought those synths last December for the same price. This tells me they have a lot of left over inventory for those models. The thing is, I own two Model Ds that I don't play, and I returned a 2600 that was a joy to play but as a clone of a 1971 instrument it didn't sound better than much smaller synths made in the past 5 years. 
             </p>
             <h3>Something New... Already in House</h3>
             <p> The Model D and 2600 are called East Coast synths because they use a filter to shape the sound. West Coast synths use wavefolding to shape the sound. East Coast took me a long time to understand. I bought a West Coast synth first, and that made no sense at all. It still doesn't make sense.</p>
             <p> A large amount of Behringer's output follows the East Coast synthesis formula of an oscillator or 3 going to a mixer going to a filter which shapes the frequencies, with an envelope generator or two to shape the volume contour (VCA) and/or the modulation of a filter.</p>
             <p>Why was I looking at buying into more East Coast synthesis? They were on sale. Here's where I would argue correctly that I don't need more synths. I don't need to pay for more synths. I need to play synths I already paid for.</p>
             <h3>Pay to Play</h3>
             <p>It makes sense you need to pay for an instrument. What instrument exactly? That decision is easy- East Beast. If you have more money and space, then a 2600. It's a beautiful instrument. If you have less money, then a Korg Volca Modular. My work here is done. </p>
             <p>This is called Joy of Synths because multiples are interesting. Most analog synths are monophonic. Having two gives you more voices. It's not unlike a band with two guitars. Why not just one? Two is twice the sound.</p>
             <H3>Play Don't Pay</H3>
             <p>The reality is you can only patch one cable at a time. I set up a single synth for recording today. That went on for a few hours. It was fun and frustrating, as these are not east coast synths so it's hard to hear what a dial turn is doing, if anything. It's too subtle to sense.</p>
             <p>On the upside, I think I did record a few minutes of usable sounds in between those hours of getting dialed in. I need to believe that, or else I'll despair! </p>
             <h3>Recording Not Rehearsal</h3>
             <p>A synth should be accompanied with a recorder of some sort. There are no rehearsals with synthesizers. They aren't robots with instant recall. A sound will appear and disappear with the slight turn of a dial. Best to be recording everything rather than regret the delusion of rehearsal. Anytime the synth is on is worth recording. Even when it's two hours of mostly useless drilling down. The two hours are the process.</p>
             <p>Recording Video for two hours is too much to ask. I put that demand on myself. The result was I didn't play synths. It was too much to find a place to film and record audio as I'm learning an instrument. Yes, it would be cool to nail it all in one take. But it's a two hour process. It's bearable with a portable audio recorder.</p>
             <p>I think of Joy of Synths as a learning series for creating sounds, and a recording series of sounds. The learning stuff is on video. The recording stuff is audio recorder only. </p>
                 
                <p>Thanks for reading this far.</p>
